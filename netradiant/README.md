Netradiant
==========

Installation
------------

In the Netradiant preferences under *Settings/Paths*, point *Engine Path* to the folder that contains the game assets. After a map compilation, the gamepack will make the editor attempt to run `/usr/bin/unvanquished` instead of a binary inside this path.
